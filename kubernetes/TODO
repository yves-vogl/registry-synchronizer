- Stateful set for Redis and the main component (which creates and publishes jobs)
- Deployment and HPA for spawning concurrent workers (which fetch their stuff from Redis)

Either everything is run like job,


A (Cron)Job:
- so python3 app/main.py --mapfile maps/example.yaml [--concurrency 5] queue is run once

A deployment:
- workers start, work and wait if nothing is available to do

HPA takes care of scaling the deployment.
